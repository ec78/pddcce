# GAUSS Panel Data Dynamic Common-Correlated Effects Model
Econometric package for performing panel data dynamic common-correled effects model (DCCE).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
The DCCE library requires:

1.  A working copy of **GAUSS 23+**.


### Installing
The GAUSS state space library can be installed using the [GAUSS applications installer](https://www.aptech.com/support/installation/using-the-applications-installer-wizard/).

**Please do not download the source code and install manually. You will not be able to properly install the library.**

Before using the functions created by `dccelib` you will need to load the newly created `dccelib` library. This can be done in a number of ways:
  *  Navigate to the library tool view window and click the small wrench located next to the `dccelib` library. Select `Load Library`.  
  *  Enter `library dccelib` in the program input/output window.
  *  Put the line `library dccelib;` at the beginning of your program files.

>  Note: I have provided the individual files found in `sslib_1.0.zip` for examination and review. However, installation should always be done using the GAUSS Package Manager.

### Examples
After installing the library, examples for all available procedures can be found in your **GAUSS** home directory in the directory **pkgs > dccelib >examples**.

The following example files are currently included in the GAUSS dccelib:

|File      |     Description              |
|----------|------------------------------|
| mg_penn.e | Example mean group estimation using a panel dataset from the Penn World Tables. The data ranges from 1960 to 2007.|
|cce_penn.e | Example common-correlated effects estimation using a panel dataset from the Penn World Tables. The data ranges from 1960 to 2007.|
|dcce_penn.e | Example dynamic common-correlated effects estimation using a panel dataset from the Penn World Tables. The data ranges from 1960 to 2007.|
